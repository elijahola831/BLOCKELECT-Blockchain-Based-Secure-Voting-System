# üîß MetaMask Circuit Breaker Fix

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem: MetaMask "Circuit Breaker" Error

MetaMask has a security feature that temporarily blocks connections when it detects rapid connection attempts. This is what's causing the error you're seeing.

## ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE FIX (Manual Steps):

### Step 1: Reset MetaMask
1. **Click on MetaMask extension**
2. **Click the profile icon (top right)**
3. **Click "Settings"**
4. **Scroll down and click "Reset Account"** (this clears connection cache)
5. **Confirm the reset**

### Step 2: Manually Add Ganache Network
1. **In MetaMask, click the network dropdown** (currently shows something like "Ethereum Mainnet")
2. **Click "Add Network"**
3. **Click "Add a network manually"**
4. **Enter these EXACT values:**

```
Network Name: Ganache Local
RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:7545
Chain ID: 1337
Currency Symbol: ETH
```

5. **Click "Save"**
6. **Switch to the new "Ganache Local" network**

### Step 3: Import Test Account
1. **Click the account icon in MetaMask**
2. **Click "Import Account"**
3. **Select "Private Key"**
4. **Paste this test private key:**
```
0x4f3edf983ac636a65a842ce7c78d9aa706d3b113bce9c46f30d7d21715b23b1d
```
5. **Click "Import"**

### Step 4: Refresh and Try Again
1. **Close MetaMask completely**
2. **Wait 30 seconds**
3. **Refresh your browser page**
4. **Open MetaMask**
5. **Try connecting again**

## üöÄ Alternative: Use Simple Connect Button

If the circuit breaker persists, look for the **orange "ü¶ä Connect MetaMask (Simple)" button** in the top-right corner of the page. This uses a simpler connection method that bypasses the circuit breaker.

## üîÑ If Still Having Issues:

1. **Restart your browser completely**
2. **Make sure Ganache is running** (use COMPLETE_SETUP.bat)
3. **Try in an incognito/private window**
4. **Clear browser cache and cookies**

## ‚è∞ Why This Happens:

- MetaMask's security system prevents rapid connection attempts
- Usually resolves automatically after 1-2 minutes
- Common during development when testing repeatedly

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators:

Once fixed, you should see:
- MetaMask shows "Connected" status
- Network shows "Ganache Local"
- Account address is visible
- No more circuit breaker errors

# BLOCKELECT: Blockchain-Based Secure Voting System

## 💡 Abstract

*Traditional electoral systems exhibit critical vulnerabilities including vote manipulation, centralized points of failure, and compromised transparency that undermine democratic integrity. This research presents a decentralised blockchain-based secure voting system designed to address these challenges. The system employs Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity to enforce immutable voting rules, Web3.js for blockchain integration, and MetaMask wallet authentication for secure voter verification. The architecture implements dual interfaces for voters and electoral commissions, with distributed consensus mechanisms ensuring real-time transaction validation. Smart contracts automatically enforce electoral rules while maintaining cryptographic immutability of voting transactions. The decentralised design eliminates single points of failure by distributing vote storage and validation across multiple nodes. System validation included unit, integration, system, and security testing. Results show prevention of vote tampering, elimination of double voting, and transparent, auditable election results. Implementation used Truffle framework, Ganache blockchain simulation, and Node.js back-end services following an Agile Prototype-based Iterative Development methodology. This work demonstrates blockchain’s feasibility in creating trustworthy electoral systems, offering a viable solution to electoral fraud and public confidence issues.*

> This software was developed as part of a final year project work at the Department of Computer Science, Plateau State University, Bokkos, titled ‘Design and Implementation of a Blockchain-Based Secure Voting System’ by Ughili Samuel Adiwu. The paper would be available here after it has been defended.

## ⚙️ Features

- Uses Web3 wallet authentication for secure, decentralised user address verification.
- Employs Ethereum smart contracts to immutably record and secure votes on-chain.
- Removes centralised databases by using blockchain’s tamper-proof distributed ledger.
- Offers a permissioned commission dashboard with role-based management controls and real-time election monitoring.
- Provides a clean UI for seamless voting, transparent candidate information, and live blockchain feedback.

## 🛠️ Requirements

The following software versions are recommended for deploying this application (other versions might work).

- Node.js `v22.14.0`
- Web3.js `v1.10.0`
- Express.js `v4.17.14`
- Solidity `v0.8.19` (solc-js)
- Truffle `v5.11.5` (core: 5.11.5)

## üîß **How to Run Your Enhanced System**

### **Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)**
```bash
# If you have basic dependencies already installed
npm start
```

### **Option 2: Full Setup**
```bash
# 1. Install core dependencies (run until successful)
npm install express truffle web3 --save

# 2. Start Ganache blockchain
npm run ganache

# 3. Compile and deploy contracts (new terminal)
npm run compile
npm run migrate

# 4. Bundle frontend (if needed)
npm run bundle

# 5. Start the enhanced server
npm start
```

### **Option 3: Minimal Dependencies**
If npm is having issues, you can still run with basic features:
```bash
# Install only essential packages
npm install express@4.21.0 --save
npm install truffle@5.11.5 --save
npm install web3@1.10.4 --save

# Then start normally
npm start
```

## üåü **Access Your Enhanced Features**

Once the server is running, access:

1. **Main Voting Interface**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Analytics Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000/analytics.html  ‚≠ê
3. **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:3000/official.html
4. **System Health**: http://localhost:3000/api/health
5. **PWA Manifest**: http://localhost:3000/manifest.json

## üí° **Handling Missing Dependencies**

### **Chart.js (Analytics Dashboard)**
If Chart.js isn't installed, add this to `src/analytics.html`:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
```
*(Already included in the file)*

### **IPFS Features**
IPFS features will gracefully fallback to basic functionality if the package isn't available.

### **ZK Proofs**
ZK proof features are self-contained and don't require external dependencies.

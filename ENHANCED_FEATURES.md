**Smart Contract Enhancements:**
```solidity
// New proposal system with multi-sig controls
struct Proposal {
    uint id;
    ProposalType proposalType;
    bytes data;
    address proposer;
    uint confirmations;
    bool executed;
    mapping(address => bool) confirmed;
    uint timestamp;
}
```

### 3. üì± **Progressive Web App (PWA)**
**Location**: `src/manifest.json`, `src/sw.js`, `src/offline.html`

**Features:**
- **Installable App**: Can be installed on phones/computers like a native app
- **Offline Mode**: Works without internet (cached data and queue votes)
- **Push Notifications**: Real-time election updates
- **Background Sync**: Automatically submits votes when connection returns
- **App Shortcuts**: Quick access to voting, analytics, and admin panels

**PWA Capabilities:**
- Service Worker for offline functionality
- Web App Manifest for installation
- Background sync for offline votes
- Push notification support

### 4. üåê **IPFS Decentralized Storage**
**Location**: `src/js/ipfs-client.js`

**Features:**
- **Candidate Profiles**: Store photos, manifestos, and detailed information
- **Election Documents**: Decentralized storage of election-related files
- **File Validation**: Automatic file type and size validation
- **Gateway Support**: Works with local IPFS node or public gateways

**IPFS Integration:**
```javascript
// Example: Upload candidate profile with photo and manifesto
const profile = await ipfsClient.createCandidateProfile({
    name: "John Doe",
    party: "Democratic Party",
    bio: "Experienced leader..."
}, photoFile, manifestoFile);
```

### 5. üîê **Zero-Knowledge Proof Privacy**
**Location**: `src/js/zk-voting.js`

**Features:**
- **Private Voting**: Vote choices remain secret but verifiable
- **Cryptographic Proofs**: Mathematical guarantees of vote validity
- **Nullifier System**: Prevents double voting while maintaining privacy
- **Vote Encryption**: Encrypted vote storage with selective disclosure

**ZK Implementation:**
```javascript
// Create privacy-preserving vote proof
const zkProof = await zkVoting.createVoteProof(
    candidateIndex, 
    voterAddress, 
    nonce
);

// Verify proof without revealing vote choice
const isValid = await zkVoting.verifyProof(zkProof, commitment);
```
